## General Information
- The problem statement is about increasing the demand of usage of shared bike and being competitive in the market. 
- Based on the data given we have to arrive a overall correlation between the no of rentals booked in various factors (Months, Seasons and Days (Holidays, festivals etc)).

## Conclusions
- The model accounts for 85.2% of the variance in bike rental demand.
- Temperature and season are among the most influential predictors.
- Weather conditions have a significant impact on rental trends.
- A clear yearly trend indicates an increase in demand.
